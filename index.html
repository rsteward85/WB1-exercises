    <h1>The City Of Tampa Bay</h1>
    <p>
      Tampa is a city on Tampa Bay, along Florida's Gulf Coast. A major business
      center, it's also known for its museums and other cultural offerings.
      Busch Gardens is an African-themed amusement park with thrill rides and
      animal-viewing areas. The historic Ybor City neighborhood, developed by
      Cuban and Spanish cigar-factory workers at the turn of the 20th century,
      is a dining and nightlife destination. <br />
      Finance, retail, healthcare, insurance, shipping by air and sea, national
      defense, professional sports, tourism, and real estate all play vital
      roles in the area's economy.[117] Hillsborough County alone has an
      estimated 740,000 employees, a figure which is projected to increase to
      922,000 by 2015.[117] Since the year 2000, Tampa has seen a notable
      upsurge in high-market demand from consumers, signaling more wealth
      concentrated in the area.[118] In 2021, the US Department of Labor awarded
      a two-year grant of nearly US$3 million to a program called "Connecting
      Talent to Careers" led by the Advanced Robotics for Manufacturing
      Institute and Tooling U-SME to deliver a rapid re-employment program to
      address a shortage of skilled labor in manufacturing in the region exposed
      by the COVID-19 pandemic.[119]
